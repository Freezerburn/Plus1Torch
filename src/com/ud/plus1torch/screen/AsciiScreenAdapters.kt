// TODO: Create a function that can be passed to AsciiScreen render that uses libgdx-specific things to draw.
//  Should be able to render any given AsciiScreen at any position on the screen. This will be useful with the
//  UI-only mode of AsciiScreen's to be able to build text-only UIs out of screen.
